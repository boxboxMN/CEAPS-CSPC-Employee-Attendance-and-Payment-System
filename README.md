🔐 **CEAPS Portal – Admin & Employee Login System**

The ***CSPC Employee Attendance and Payment System (CEAPS)*** is an internal web-based management system designed to streamline employee timekeeping, attendance monitoring, and payroll computation for college staff. The system emphasizes data accuracy, secure access control, and efficient record management through a role-based Admin and Employee portal.

Built using ***PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript***, CEAPS implements secure authentication with session handling and password hashing, alongside an intuitive landing page that routes users to the appropriate portal based on their role.

*This system was developed as the Final Project for the Advanced Database System Course SY 2024–2025, under the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program.*
